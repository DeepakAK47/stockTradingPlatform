        <div className="col-5 mb-5">
        <p className="mt-5">Our principles—customer interest over growth, transparency, and our product development philosophies—are the reasons why millions of customers have come to trust us over the years. Today, 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ₹6 lakh crores of equity investments and contribute to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Central to our philosophies are: not advertising, spamming, pushing, or inducing customers to take actions that are not in their interest.</p>

        <div className="col-5 mb-5 ">
            <p className="mt-5">As a for-profit company, we have no external investor pressure, thanks to us being bootstrapped and profitable from our early days. Inside Zerodha, employees do not have perverse incentives as we do not impose any metric-based growth targets; be it accounts opened, app install counts, orders placed, or revenue generated.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Our drive, thus has been an unwavering focus on depth and quality. From an unknown upstart in 2010 to serving crores of customers, word-of-mouth referrals are what have driven our growth.</p>
